# picaxe_jack_o_lantern_lights
LED flicker effect using a Picaxe microcontroller for a Jack O Lantern.

This is originally meant for usage with a Picaxe 08M2 chip with a single PWM output pin (C.2), but any Picaxe chip should work.

Use a yellow LED with 220 Ohm resistor connected to C.2 for a candle-like effect. Although the 08M2 has only the one suitable PWM output, you can connect two LEDs in parallel (with extra 220 Ohm resistor) to the same pin, if desired.

I'll post a full project description in the future.
