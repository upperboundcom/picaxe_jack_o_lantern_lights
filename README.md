LED flicker effect using a picaxe for a Jack O Lantern

This is originally meant for usage with a 08M2 with a single pwm output pin (C.2), but any picaxe chip should work.

Use a yellow LED with 220ohm resistor connected to C.2 for a candle-like effect. Although the 08M2 only the one suitable pwm output, you can connect two LEDs in parallel to the same pin, if desired.

I'll post a full project description in the future.
